### WEHI Research Computing Platform (RCP)

We are a group of software engineers with broad experiences in different research fields and computational sciences. Our objective is to support WEHI's strategic plan by investigating and building new capabilities in computational research and data analytics. We collaborate with researchers to help them get their computational research running on WEHI infrastructure, or where appropriate, on external resources such as commercial and research clouds, and local and national facilities. 

We are **research software engineers**, **passionate** about finding optimised, reproducible, efficient solutions to researchers' computational problems.
